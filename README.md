# About

This repository contains a collection of daily utilities, including small shell scripts, functions and aliases.

> **Warning.** The scripts were not carefully revised. So, be careful when using them.

# Criteria

The criteria I used to put something here rather than in a separated project is the following:
1. single file script with at most one or two auxiliary functions
2. it is not yaml/json configurable
3. it is not well documented
4. it has no completion script

In sum, what is here is what could be put in a gist.

# Dynamics

The dynamics involving the creation of these utilities is the following:
1. I need something or I have some idea
2. I sketch it, do minor tests and put in this repository
3. Anytime I want an improved or customized version of some util, I implement it in this repo, and then use the new version in some other project
4. Eventually, if I decide to really improve the utility, it will be promoted to a project, being moved to its own repository.

# Other

For a list of third party utilities, see [utils](./utils.md).
